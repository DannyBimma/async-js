Asynchronous JavaScript:
Normally, a given program's code runs straight along, with only one thing happening at once. If a function relies on the result of another function, it has to wait for the other function to finish and return, and until that happens, the entire program is essentially stopped from the perspective of the user.

Mac users, for example, sometimes experience this as the spinning rainbow-colored cursor (or "beachball" as it is often called). This cursor is how the operating system says "the current program you're using has had to stop and wait for something to finish up, and it's taking so long that I was worried you'd wonder what was going on."

This is a frustrating experience and isn't a good use of computer processing power â€” especially in an era in which computers have multiple processor cores available. There's no sense sitting there waiting for something when you could let the other task chug along on another processor core and let you know when it's done. This lets you get other work done in the meantime, which is the basis of asynchronous programming. It is up to the programming environment you are using (web browsers, in the case of web development) to provide you with APIs that allow you to run such tasks asynchronously. 
Asynchronous techniques are very useful, particularly in web programming. When a web app runs in a browser and it executes an intensive chunk of code without returning control to the browser, the browser can appear to be frozen. This is called blocking; the browser is blocked from continuing to handle user input and perform other tasks until the web app returns control of the processor.

AJAX Calls:
JavaScript has multiple ways of making AJAX calls, and one of the most old school ways is through the XML-HTTP-Request function. It works by basically storing the result of the function call into a variable. Next, you will need the URL to which you will be making the AJAX call. This is done by calling the open method on the object created by the XML-HTTP-Request function. The open method then accepts two parameters, the first is the type of request, and the second is a string containing the URL to which the AJAX call is to be made. The string containing the AJAX call URL is also known as the API endpoint. After that the request just need to be sent by calling the send method on the object created by the XML-HTTP-Request function.
